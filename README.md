redis-job-queue
===============

Abstraction on top of the redis `list` data type for queueing data. There are two main classes,
`QueueConsumer` and `QueuePublisher`. `QueueConsumer`, as the name suggests, consumer data from
a queue, while `QueuePublisher` publishes data to a queue. Both also have helper methods for
dealing specifically with job processing. That code is fairly well commented, so it's probably
best to just read the docs in the actual file.

The QueuePublisher has the ability to create jobs and call a callback on them when the job is
complete. This is done by using a little bit of hacker and [redis pubsub](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub).

Before a job is sent to the queue, a unique, random `id` is assigned to it. The queue publisher
first `subscribes` to pubsub channel with the name `id` and the publishes the job to queue. When
the queue consumer on the other end is finished processing that job, it `publishes` any data
generated by that job to a pubsub channel with the `name` id. This data will be received by the
queue publisher, which then stops listening on the channel named `id` and then calls the callback
supplied for that job.

_todo_

* Currently, only the queue publisher has explicit code for handling jobs. The code that handles
jobs on the queue consumer side is still setting in the docker\_processor.js file and needs to be 
adapted and moved into redqueue.js.
